# Script-Ware
This is script-ware's full script execution source, this works if you update the proto struct and addresses, i've included elysians call encryption and eternals shit non-functional trash for the enc (which you could try to fix, however i couldnt and neither could he)

if you update proto struct and addresses, you're able to call closures because op_call's encryption was not changed and this has it updated.

This has practically everything the old source had, i've commented upon the code of which i have used from other people (not much)
but remember! This is **roblox exploiting!** you're not permitted to use a SINGLE piece of code from someone else without a moron screaming that you're incapable

# Reference to the old source being leaked
"leaking it because he's only made 10% of it"
ahem... that was very rude. script-ware was made by me and quad core, idk where you got _that_ from.
yes sure, it's always used elysians encryption for call/jmp however that does not mean i've only created
a **TENTH** of the applications code. >:(

If you saw the core of it, it's basically that inside a gui, this has the following things:
- pretty much all the enc works apart from eternals broken shit
- callcheck bypass that is functional
- getobjects implementation that works
- current custom implementations to the environment:
- toclipboard
- loadstring
- printconsole
- errorconsole
- writefile
- readfile
- runfile
- getrawmetatable

# Omg, can I use this?
you can take this, make ur own project and sell it for all i care, you'll be helping the ebola type exploiting community
die, and that is what we **ALL** want :)
